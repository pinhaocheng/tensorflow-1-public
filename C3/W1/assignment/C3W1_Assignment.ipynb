everything is possible and available to them   said mr hanlon.  ultimately  the consumer will tell the market they want.   of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces  many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them  instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies  directtv  has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability  instant replay  and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo  called tivotogo  which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want  when they want.\n","\n"]}],"source":["with open(\"./bbc-text.csv\", 'r') as csvfile:\n","    print(f\"First line (header) looks like this:\\n\\n{csvfile.readline()}\")\n","    print(f\"Each data point looks like this:\\n\\n{csvfile.readline()}\")     "],"id":"sjMMidApFDnS"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o7JxHHo8FDnT"},"source":["As you can see, each data point is composed of the category of the news article followed by a comma and then the actual text of the article."],"id":"o7JxHHo8FDnT"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kD6Xolv6FDnT"},"source":["## Removing Stopwords\n","\n","One important step when working with text data is to remove the **stopwords** from it.
